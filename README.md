### Usage
On the right side of the nav bar you will find 4 nav links. The first three will pull you to different points of the page. The last one should take you to my personal github repository.

The hero image features a button that will take you to my personal linkedin.

The button on the larger main feature card will take you to my first HTML / CSS project from module 1. The smaller feature card buttons will take you to corresponding wiki pages relating to the material.

The contact section has links, however they are not connected to anything yet.
